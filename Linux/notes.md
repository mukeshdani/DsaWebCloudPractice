## üêß **How to Install Linux Environments**

1. **Vagrant (by HashiCorp)**  
   - A tool for building and managing virtual machine environments using simple configuration files.
   - Ideal for developers who want reproducible environments.

2. **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**  
   - Allows you to run a Linux distribution directly on Windows without a virtual machine.
   - Great for developers who use Windows but need Linux tools.

3. **VirtualBox**  
   - A free and open-source virtualisation tool to run Linux as a guest OS on any host OS.
   - Useful for testing and learning Linux without affecting your main system.

4. **Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)**  
   - You can create Linux virtual machines (VMs) on cloud services.
   - Ideal for scalable, remote development and deployment.

## üß† **Linux System Overview**

- **Operating System (OS)**: Linux
- **Core Component**: **Kernel**
  - Written in **C programming language**
  - Manages hardware and system resources
- **Shell**: Interface between user and kernel
  - Accepts commands like `mkdir`, `ls`, etc.
  - Acts as a gateway to communicate with the kernel

## üîÅ **Boot Process in Linux**

1. **Bootloader**: First program that runs when the computer starts.
2. **GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)**: Loads and manages the Linux kernel.
3. **Kernel**: Starts system processes and manages hardware.
4. **Shell & Desktop Environment**: Provides user interface (terminal, icons, etc.)
