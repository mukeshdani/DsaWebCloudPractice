Design Patterns Overview

Definition:
Design patterns are proven solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices refined through experience and are widely used in object-oriented software development.

Key Insight:
While developers often face similar problems, their approaches may vary. Design patterns offer a shared vocabulary and structure to solve these problems efficiently.

Types of Design Patterns
Design patterns are broadly categorized into three types:

1. Creational Patterns
   Focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
   Examples:
   - Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - Factory Method
   - Builder

2. Structural Patterns
   Deal with object composition and typically help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn’t need to do the same.
   Examples:
   - Adapter
   - Proxy

3. Behavioral Patterns
   Focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together.
   Examples:
   - Observer
   - State
   - Iterator

Historical Background
- Christopher Alexander was the first to introduce the concept of design patterns in 1977, originally in the context of architecture.
- The concept was later adapted to software engineering by the Gang of Four (GoF) — Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides — in their influential 1994 book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".
