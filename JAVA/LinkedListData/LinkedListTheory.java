// LinkedList class
/*
 * LinkedList class is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes.
 * Linkedlist is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes.
 * Each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
 * The first node is called the head, and the last node is called the tail.
 * 
 * LinkedList class is a collection of nodes.
 * 
 * Key features of LinkedList:
 * 1. Dynamic size: LinkedList can grow and shrink in size as needed.
 * 2. Efficient insertion and deletion: LinkedList allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.
 * 3. No need for contiguous memory: LinkedList does not require contiguous memory allocation, unlike arrays.
 * 4. Non-primitive data structure: LinkedList is a non-primitive data structure, meaning it is built using primitive data types.
 * 5. Non-linear data structure: LinkedList is a non-linear data structure, meaning it does not have a fixed size or order.
 * 6. Can store any data type: LinkedList can store any data type, including primitive and non-primitive data types.
 * 7. Can be used to implement other data structures: LinkedList can be used to implement other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables.
 * 8. Can be used to implement algorithms: LinkedList can be used to implement algorithms, such as sorting and searching.
 * 9. Can be used to implement data structures: LinkedList can be used to implement data structures, such as trees and graphs.

 * Pointer in Java
 * ---------------
 * in java there is a pointers but it is Implicit Pointer: Programer can't handle or not able to handle
 * No Explicit Pointers in java Automatically handled by JVM
