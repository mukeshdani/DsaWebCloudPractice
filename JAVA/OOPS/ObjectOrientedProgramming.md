ðŸŒŸ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explained Simply

ðŸ”¹ Programming Paradigms
Programming can be approached in different styles or methodologies:

Procedural Programming â€“ Step-by-step instructions (like C).
Functional Programming â€“ Focuses on functions and immutability (like Haskell).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ Based on objects and classes (like C++, Java, Python).

ðŸ”¹ What is OOP?
OOP is a programming concept that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic.

Most modern programming languages support OOP, including:
âœ… C++
âœ… Java
âœ… Python
âœ… C#
âœ… Kotlin, Swift, and many more

ðŸ”¹ Class vs Object
ðŸ§± Class â€“ The Blueprint
A class is like a blueprint or design plan. It defines:

Properties (also called data members or attributes)
Behaviors (also called methods or functions)
Example: Designing a Car on paper

Properties: color, number of seats (e.g., 4 seats), shape
Behaviors: move forward, turn headlights on, open doors

ðŸš— Object â€“ The Real Thing
An object is a real-world implementation of a class. It is an instance of a class.

Example: Actually building the car using the blueprint

Now the car has real color, real seats, and can perform actions like driving.

ðŸ”¹ Method vs Function â€“ Whatâ€™s the Difference?

âœ… All methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.
