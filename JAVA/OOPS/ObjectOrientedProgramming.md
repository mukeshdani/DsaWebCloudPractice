ðŸŒŸ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Explained Simply

ðŸ”¹ Programming Paradigms
Programming can be approached in different styles or methodologies:

Procedural Programming â€“ Step-by-step instructions (like C).
Functional Programming â€“ Focuses on functions and immutability (like Haskell).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ Based on objects and classes (like C++, Java, Python).

ðŸ”¹ What is OOP?
OOP is a programming concept that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic.

Most modern programming languages support OOP, including:
âœ… C++
âœ… Java
âœ… Python
âœ… C#
âœ… Kotlin, Swift, and many more

ðŸ”¹ Class vs Object
ðŸ§± Class â€“ The Blueprint
A class is like a blueprint or design plan. It defines:

Properties (also called data members or attributes)
Behaviors (also called methods or functions)
Example: Designing a Car on paper

Properties: color, number of seats (e.g., 4 seats), shape
Behaviors: move forward, turn headlights on, open doors

ðŸš— Object â€“ The Real Thing
An object is a real-world implementation of a class. It is an instance of a class.

Example: Actually building the car using the blueprint

Now the car has real color, real seats, and can perform actions like driving.

ðŸ”¹ Method vs Function â€“ Whatâ€™s the Difference?

âœ… All methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.

ðŸ”¹ Constructor in Java
ðŸ§± What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created.

ðŸ”§ Key Properties of Constructors:
1. Same name as the class
2. No return type (not even void)
3. Automatically called when an object is created
4. Used to initialize object data

Constructors Overloading:
When we create multiple constructors in one class, it is called Constructors Overloading.
1. Argument list should not match.
2. Type of argument should be different.
3. Order of arguments may differ.
At least one of these must be there for constructor overloading.

Method Overloading:
When we create multiple methods with the same name, it is called Method Overloading.
Having multiple methods in the same class with the same name.
1. Argument list should not match.
2. Type of argument should be different.
3. Order of arguments may differ.
At least one of these must be there for Method Overloading.

In overloading, return type does not create any difference.

this Keyword in OOPS:
This refers to the current invoking object.
this(): used for the current class constructor from inside a different constructor of the same class.

Example:
class Test {
    public void show() {
        this.a;
    }
}
Test t = new Test();
t.show(); // here this refers to new Test() means t

Test t2 = new Test();
t2.show(); // here this refers to new Test() means t2

this refers to the current invoking object.

this(): calls the constructor depending upon the argument.
this(): this must be the first line/statement.

Inheritance in Java:
Inheritance is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features of another class.

Example:
class Animal {
    void eat() {}
    void color() {}
} // Parent Class/Super Class/Base Class

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Dog inherits eat() and color() methods from Animal
} // Sub class/Child class/Derived Class

Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance: 1 parent and 1 child.
2. Multi-Level Inheritance.
3. Hierarchical Inheritance: 1 parent and multiple children.
4. Multiple Inheritance: 1 child and multiple parents (not supported using classes but can be supported using interfaces).
5. Hybrid Inheritance.
6. Cyclic Inheritance: Loop A extends A and is not supported in Java. A extends B, B extends A. In simple Java, cyclic inheritance is not supported.

super Keyword:
Refers to the immediate parent class object.

super(): used to call the parent class constructor.
super(): this must be the first line/statement.
Used to call the parent class constructor from inside the child class constructor.
