## ğŸ”¹ **4. Virtualization vs. Containerization**

| Virtual Machines (VMs) | Containers |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Uses **hypervisor** (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox). | Uses **container engine** (e.g., Docker). |
| Each VM has its own OS. | Containers share the host OS kernel. |
| Heavy, high resource usage. | Lightweight, faster, less resource hungry. |
| Slower boot time. | Instant start-up. |

**Analogy:**

> VM: Full house with its own kitchen, bathroom, etc.
> Container: Flat in an apartment sharing main building facilities.
