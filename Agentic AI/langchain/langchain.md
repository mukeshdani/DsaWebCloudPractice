# üß† LangChain Architecture and Agentic Frameworks

---

## üìå Chapter 1: What is LangChain?

LangChain is a **framework for building applications powered by language models (LLMs)**. It enables LLMs to:

- Use **external tools** (APIs, databases, search engines).
- Maintain **memory** across conversations.
- Follow **chains of logic** or workflows.
- Act as **agents** that can reason and decide what to do next.

## üèóÔ∏è Chapter 2: LangChain Architecture (End-to-End)

### Core Components:

1. **LLM (Language Model)**  
   The brain of the system (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4). It generates responses, makes decisions, and interprets user input.

2. **Prompt Templates**  
   Predefined templates that structure how the LLM is asked questions.  
   Example:  
   ```python
   PromptTemplate.from_template("What is the capital of {country}?")
   ```

3. **Chains**  
   A sequence of calls (LLM + tools + logic).  
   Example:  
   `User input ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Tool ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Output`

4. **Tools**  
   External functions the LLM can use (e.g., web search, SQL, file reading). Tools are described so the LLM knows when and how to use them.

5. **Agents**  
   The decision-makers. Agents decide which tool to use, what to ask, and how to respond. They use reasoning strategies like **ReAct** (Reason + Act).

6. **Memory**  
   Stores conversation history or intermediate results. Useful for chatbots or multi-step reasoning.

## ü§ñ Chapter 3: Agent Types in LangChain

LangChain supports several agent types:

### 1. **Zero-shot-react-description**
- LLM chooses tools based on their descriptions.
- Example:
  ```python
  agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description")
  agent.run("Search for the latest AI news.")
  ```

### 2. **Conversational-react-description**
- Same as above but with memory.
- Example:
  ```python
  agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="conversational-react-description", memory=memory)
  agent.run("Remind me what I asked earlier.")
  ```

### 3. **ReAct Docstore**
- Uses ReAct with a document store like Wikipedia.
- Example:
  ```python
  agent = initialize_agent(["wikipedia"], llm, agent="react-docstore")
  agent.run("Who discovered penicillin?")
  ```

### 4. **Self-ask-with-search**
- LLM asks follow-up questions and uses search.
- Example:
  ```python
  agent = initialize_agent(["search"], llm, agent="self-ask-with-search")
  agent.run("What is the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is?")
  ```

### 5. **Plan-and-execute**
- Breaks down complex tasks into subtasks.
- Example:
  ```python
  agent = initialize_agent(["planner", "executor"], llm, agent="plan-and-execute")
  agent.run("Write a blog post and publish it.")
  ```

## üß† Chapter 4: Memory in LangChain

LangChain **can be stateful** using memory components.

### Why Memory?
- Retains context across multiple interactions.
- Useful for chatbots, multi-step reasoning, and long conversations.

### Types of Memory:

| Memory Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ConversationBufferMemory` | Stores full conversation history in memory. |
| `ConversationSummaryMemory` | Summarizes past messages using an LLM. |
| `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` | Stores only the last *k* messages. |
| `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` | Stores memory as embeddings in a vector DB. |
| `ZepMemory`, `RedisMemory` | External memory backends for long-term memory. |

### Example:
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
agent = initialize_agent(tools=[], llm=llm, agent="conversational-react-description", memory=memory)
agent.run("Hi, my name is Raj.")
agent.run("What is my name?")
```

## üß† Bonus: What is ReAct?

**ReAct** stands for **Reason + Act**. It‚Äôs a prompting strategy where the LLM:
1. **Thinks step-by-step** (reasoning).
2. **Chooses and uses tools** (acting).
3. **Reflects and continues** until the task is complete.

LangChain agents like `zero-shot-react-description` use this strategy to decide which tool to use and how to use it.

## üß∞ Tools You Used (Explained)

### 1. **DuckDuckGo Search Tool**
```python
from langchain_community.tools.ddg_search.tool import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
```
- **Purpose**: Performs real-time web searches using DuckDuckGo.
- **Use Case**: When the LLM needs **fresh or current information** (e.g., trending movies).
- **How it works**: The LLM sends a query to DuckDuckGo, retrieves results, and uses them to answer the user's question.

---

### 2. **Wikipedia Search Tool**
```python
from langchain_community.utilities.wikipedia import WikipediaAPIWrapper
```
- **Purpose**: Searches Wikipedia for summaries and articles.
- **Use Case**: When the user asks for **factual or historical information** (e.g., "Who is Alan Turing?").
- **How it works**: The tool queries Wikipedia and returns a summary of the topic.

---

### 3. **SQL Database Toolkit**
```python
from langchain_community.utilities.sql_database import SQLDatabase
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.toolkit import SQLDatabaseToolkit
```
- **Purpose**: Allows the LLM to interact with SQL databases.
- **Use Case**: When the user wants to **query structured data** (e.g., inventory stock).
- **How it works**:
  - Connects to a SQLite database.
  - The LLM translates natural language into SQL queries.
  - Executes the query and returns the result.

---

### 4. **Arxiv Search Tool**
```python
from langchain_community.tools.arxiv.tool import ArxivQueryRun
```
- **Purpose**: Searches academic papers on arXiv.org.

- **How it works**: Sends a query to arXiv and returns relevant paper titles and abstracts.

---

### 5. **Read File Tool**
```python
from langchain_community.tools.file_management import ReadFileTool
```
- **Purpose**: Reads the content of a local file.
- **Use Case**: When the user wants to **analyze or summarize a file** (e.g., "Read example.txt").
- **How it works**: The tool opens the file, reads its content, and passes it to the LLM for processing.

---

## üß† How LangChain Works (Deep Dive)

### üîÅ 1. **Agent Initialization**
```python
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)
```
- **Agent**: A controller that decides when and how to use tools.
- **Zero-shot-react-description**: A strategy where the LLM reasons step-by-step and decides which tool to use based on the query.

### üß© 2. **Tool Integration**
- Tools are passed as a list to the agent.
- The LLM is aware of each tool's **name**, **function**, and **description**.
- Based on the user query, the LLM chooses the right tool and uses it.

### üß† 3. **LLM Reasoning**
- The LLM interprets the query.
- If it needs external data, it calls the appropriate tool.
- It then uses the tool's output to generate a final response.
