## 🚀 End-to-End Projects (LLaMA 3.2 + Node.js + React)

1. **AI-Powered Trip Advisor**
2. **AI Chatbot**
3. **News Summarization System**

Each will include:
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + LLaMA 3.2 integration
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Agent logic**: CrewAI-style modular structure

Let me start generating the code and folder structure. This will take a few moments.

✅ The **folder structure** and **starter code** for the following CrewAI-based projects have been successfully generated:

## 🧠 Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Package this into downloadable zip files?
2. Help you deploy this (e.g., on Vercel, Render, or local server)?
3. Add advanced features like **agent memory**, **delegation**, or **chat history**?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
