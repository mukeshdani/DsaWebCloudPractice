## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1: What are the core components of the OpenAI Agents SDK?**  
A1: The core components are Agents (LLM wrappers with logic), Handoffs (control transfer between agents), and Guardrails (safety and control mechanisms).

**Q2: How do you run an agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK?**  
A2: Create an Agent instance, optionally wrap it with `trace()` for monitoring, and run it asynchronously using `Runner.run()`.

**Q3: What is the difference between a tool and a handoff in the SDK?**  
A3: A tool is a callable function or agent that returns control to the caller, while a handoff transfers control permanently to another agent without returning.

**Q4: How does the SDK support multi-agent workflows?**  
A4: Agents can be run in parallel using `asyncio.gather()`, and agents can call other agents as tools. Planning agents can orchestrate complex workflows.

**Q5: What is the purpose of guardrails in the SDK?**  
A5: Guardrails enforce input/output validation to ensure agents behave responsibly and prevent misuse or errors.

**Q6: How does the SDK enable monitoring and debugging?**  
A6: Using the `trace()` context manager, interactions are logged and visualized in OpenAI’s platform under Traces.

**Q7: Can the OpenAI Agents SDK work with models other than OpenAI’s?**  
A7: Yes, it supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints and other LLM providers like Gemini, DeepSeek, and LLaMA.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agent

- Represents the LLM and its behavior.
- Defined by a role or purpose, instructions, and the model it uses.
- Example:

```python
from agents import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="jokester",
    instructions="You are a joke teller.",
    model="gpt-4-mini"
)
```

### 2. Handoff

- Represents how an agent transfers control to another agent.
- Used for delegating tasks or passing responsibility.
- Different from tools as handoffs transfer control permanently.

### 3. Guardrail

- Safety and control mechanisms to ensure agents behave responsibly.
- Can validate inputs and outputs to prevent misuse.

---

## Basic Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Create an Agent

Define the agent with a name, instructions (system prompt), and model.

```python
agent = Agent(
    name="helper",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    model="gpt-4-mini"
)
```

### Step 2: Use `trace()` for Monitoring (Optional but Recommended)

Wrap agent execution in a `trace()` context manager to log and monitor interactions.

```python
from agents import trace

with trace("Example Trace"):
    # Agent execution code here
```

### Step 3: Run the Agent

Run the agent asynchronously using `Runner.run()`.

```python
from agents import Runner
import asyncio

async def run_agent():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke.")
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(run_agent())
```

---

## Vibe Coding: Iterative Development with LLMs

- **Good Vibes**: Write clear, concise prompts.
- **Vibe but Verify**: Ask multiple LLMs the same question to compare answers.
- **Step Up the Vibe**: Break down requests into small, testable steps.
- **Vibe and Validate**: Use one LLM to generate code and another to review it.
- **Vibe with Variety**: Request multiple solutions and choose the best.

---

## Multi-Agent Workflows

- Create multiple agents with different roles or personas.
- Run agents in parallel using `asyncio.gather()`.
- Use a "sales picker" agent to select the best output.
- Wrap agents as tools using `.as_tool()` for modularity.
- Use planning agents to orchestrate workflows.

---

## Tools and Handoffs

### Tools

- Functions or agents that can be called by other agents.
- Created using `@function_tool` decorator or `.as_tool()` method.

Example of a function tool:

```python
from agents import function_tool

@function_tool
def send_email(email_body: str):
    """Send an email with the given body."""
    # Implementation here
```

### Handoffs

- Transfer control permanently to another agent.
- Used for delegation of responsibility.

---

## Trace Monitoring

- Use `trace()` to log agent interactions.
- View traces in OpenAI's platform for debugging and analysis.

---

## Guardrails

- Implement input and output validation agents.
- Prevent agents from producing inappropriate or unsafe content.

---

## Example Project: Sales Development Rep (SDR) Agent

- Multiple agents with different sales tones (professional, humorous, concise).
- Agents run in parallel to generate emails.
- A sales picker agent selects the best email.
- Integration with SendGrid for sending emails.
- Use of tools and handoffs for modular workflow.

---

## Summary

The OpenAI Agents SDK provides a simple yet powerful way to build LLM-powered agents with modularity, safety, and monitoring. It supports multi-agent workflows, tool integration, and asynchronous execution, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
