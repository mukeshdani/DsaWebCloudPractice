🤖 Agentic AI
Agentic AI means the AI can:

Make decisions
Take actions
Work with little or no human help
It acts like an agent that sees something, thinks about it, and then does something.

🎨 Generative AI
Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new things like:

Text (e.g., stories, emails)
Images
Music
Videos
It learns from existing data and then creates something new based on patterns.

Example: ChatGPT (like me!) can write answers, poems, or code.

🤝 Combining Agentic AI + Generative AI
These two can work together! Here are some examples:

1. Advertising and Marketing
    Agentic AI decides who should see an ad.
    Generative AI creates the ad content based on what the person likes.

2. Customer Support Chatbot
    Agentic AI figures out what the customer needs.
    Generative AI writes a smart and helpful reply.


🧠 What is an AI Agent?
An agent is something that:

Perceives (sees or senses the world)
Decides (thinks about what to do)
Acts (does something)

Example: Thermostat

Perceive: Senses room temperature
Decide: Is it too hot or cold?
Act: Turns heater or AC on/off


🧩 Types of AI Agents
There are 5 main types of AI agents:

1. Simple Reflex Agent
Works with basic rules like “if this, then that”
No memory, no learning
Examples:

Automatic door: If someone is near → open the door
Motion light: If movement is detected → turn on light


2. Model-Based Reflex Agent
Like a simple agent but with memory
Remembers past events to make better decisions
Example:

You say: “Call me Aarohi.”
Later you ask: “What’s my name?”
Simple agent: “I don’t know.”
Model-based agent: “Your name is Aarohi!”


3. Goal-Based Agent
Has a goal and plans how to reach it
Can replan if something changes
Examples:

GPS: Goal is to reach a destination. It checks traffic and finds the best route.
Booking a flight under ₹5000: It compares options and finds the best one.


4. Utility-Based Agent
Tries to find the best way to reach a goal
Gives each option a score and picks the best one
Example:

Chess-playing AI: Looks at 10 possible moves, scores each one, and picks the best move.


5. Learning Agent (Reinforcement Agent)
Learns from experience
Gets better over time by trying, getting feedback, and improving
